============

Known issues:

* Healer isn't handled properly. Healer should attack the attackers, not the
  target.
* Spells are not supported.
* Air and ground forces are currently mixed.

Features by design:

* We assume splash damage attack everything for simplicity.
* There is no guaranteed accuracy of the calculated result. Don't rely on this
  as the sole reference.
